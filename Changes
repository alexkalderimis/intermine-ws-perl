0.9605: Sat 12 Mar 2011 21:25:56 EST
        * Added Webservice::InterMine::Simple (see benchmarks)
            There is a compilation penalty inherent in the use of Moose
            and meta-class introspection. While perfectly acceptable 
            when multiple queries are made withing the same process, 
            for the common use case of a single query, the user may wish for
            something more performant. In this case, a script that uses 
            Webservice::InterMine::Simple will gain a full magnitude increase
            in performance (3.5p/s vs 0.33p/s). However, multiple queries
            within the same process do not see a similar improvement, it being
            more in the range of 300% (70p/s vs 250p/s). Where speed is important,
            and more sophisticated features are not required, a Simple service
            may be appealing
         * Added support for headers.
0.9700: Wed 2 June 2011
        * Changed result parsing logic - uses a JSON format internally for all 
          non trivial parsing to ensure safety of field content and diagnostics 
          of errors.
        * Enabled lazy iteration of result sets by default. This improves responsiveness
        for large datasets.
        * Incorporated iteration into queries as a transparent feature.
        * Added list services (creation, deletion, renaming, intersection, unions, differences, subtraction, appending)
        * Added summary methods (show)
        * Added template and query upload methods
0.9701: Sat 4 June 2011
        * Improved template parsing speed by only parsing what is requested
        * Improved show printing format with more appropriate column sizes, and column guides.
0.9702: Sat 4 June 2011
        * Bug-fix release - subclass parsing was broken
0.9702: Sun 5 June 2011
        * Bug-fix release - Fixed handling of empty result sets - added test
        for recently fixed bugs.
0.9703: Sun 5 June 2011
        * Bug-fix release - subclass parsing was broken
0.9704: Sun 5 June 2011
        * Added possible values service methods.
0.9705: Wed Jun  8 19:34:43 BST 2011
        * Avoid hitting url limits by posting where possible
0.9800: Added tokens for authentication
0.9801: Sun Jul 24 00:30:47 BST 2011
        Revised cookbook, chapters 1-5
        Added cookbook tests (runnable examples) 
        Added more POD
        Added sugar for constraints and views
          * Query::select for views
          * Query::where for constraints
          * Query::search for constraints + results
          * Service::resultset for queries
        Added more aliases, with docs, including
          * Query::count/get_count
        Hid internal methods, such as Query::push_constraints (and others)
        Changed logic behaviour on adding constraint (don't discard current logic completely)
0.9802: Sun Jul 24 23:38:52 BST 2011
        * Added all, first and one to runnable queries.
        * Add Query::path method for making Path objects
        * Allowed loop constraints to be built with Path objects.
0.9802: Tue Jul 26 16:31:59 BST 2011
        * Aligned handling of parsed sortorders with webserver code (tolerates broken sort-orders)
0.9804: Tue Aug  2 20:49:40 BST 2011
        * Added ResultRow objects to simplify API (one object for hash and array access). Using Class::InsideOut
        for memory reasons over MooseX::InsideOut, which leaks.
        * search and where imply select("*") if the view is empty
        * Made results default to ResultRows
0.9805: Tue Aug  2 22:12:57 BST 2011
        * Switched to JSON::XS for result parsing for performance reasons.
0.9806: Tue Aug  2 23:41:12 BST 2011

        * Deprecated username and password authentication on services that support tokens
0.9809: Mon Aug  8 17:59:19 BST 2011
        * Backwards compatibility through to version 3 regarding JSON container formats
0.9810: Bug-fix release
0.9811: Allow ResultRow#to_href to produce either short or long key versions of hrefs
0.9812: Added summarise method to runnable queries to get path summary information
0.9813: Added support for the "status" field on lists, so you know if they need manual updating or not.

0.9815: Moved simple classes out to own distribution (See: Webservice::InterMine::Simple on CPAN).
0.9816: Added list-tagging support

0.9900: Use of new json format where available
        Support for redirection and private ports

0.9901: Added remove_constraint method. 
0.9902: Added better validation of sort-orders, allowing valid orders that were previously disallowed
0.9903: Added coercion for SeviceVersion to cope with the fact that the version service now returns a new line on the end. 
        Added more tolerant list creation from queries. Now will accept queries that have non-id fields selected, as long as it is non-ambiguous what is requested.
0.9904: Added dependency on Set::Crossproduct for testing.
        More tests for list constraint construction.
        Consistent ability to use subqueries and lists in constraints.
