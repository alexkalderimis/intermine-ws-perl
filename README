NAME
    Webservice::InterMine - modules for interacting with InterMine
    datawarehouse webservices

SYNOPSIS
        use Webservice::InterMine;

        my $service  = Webservice::InterMine->new_service($url, $user, $pass);
        my $template = $service->template($name);
        my $results  = $template->results_with(valueA => 'x', valueB => 'y');

      OR

        use Webservice::InterMine 'www.flymine.org', $user, $pass;

        my $query    = Webservice::InterMine->new_query;
        $query->add_view(@views);
        $query->add_constraint(
                        path  => $path,
                        op    => $op,
                        value => $value,
                        );
        my $results  = $query->results;

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is the client interface to any implementation of the
    InterMine Datawarehousing WebService (www.intermine.org). Primarily used
    for biological genomic databases, the webservice allows the user to
    easily write and execute structured queries.

    This module allows you to interact with one or more webservices by
    providing a url to an InterMine implementation.

  Usage
    You can call "use Webservice::InterMine" without any parameters, which
    simply means you need to either specify the webservice url on every
    call, or call the methods on a service directly.

    If you call "use Webservice::InterMine $url", a default service will be
    set, meaning method calls will not require the webservice url. Unless
    you are intending to access multiple services, the latter form is
    recommended.

METHODS
  new_query( [from => \@service_args], [%query_args] )
    returns a new query object for you to fill in with constraints before
    being run to get its results.

    Parameters:

    *   from => [url, user, pass]

        An array ref of arguments to pass to get_service. This information
        can be used to specify a different service than the one named on
        import, or to specify one when none was named on import.

    *   %query_args

        Key value pairs of arguments to pass to the query constructor in
        Webservice::InterMine::Service. This methid serves as sugar for the
        factory method in that class.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query, Webservice::InterMine::Service.

  new_list( %list_args, [from => \@service_args] )
    Creates a new list with the content specified by the list arguments. The
    "content" key-word parameter will always be required. For a full
    specification of creating lists, see:
    Webservice::InterMine::ListFactory.

    Parameters:

    *   from => [url, user, pass]

        An array ref of arguments to pass to get_service. This information
        can be used to specify a different service than the one named on
        import, or to specify one when none was named on import.

    *   %list_args

        Key value pairs of arguments to pass to the list constructor in
        Webservice::InterMine::Service. This methid serves as sugar for the
        factory method in that class.

  get_list( $list_name, [from => \@service_args] )
    Get the list of the given name from the default service, or the given
    service if details are supplied.

  load_query([\@service_args], source_file|source_string => $source, %opts )
    Returns a query object based on xml you have previously saved, either as
    a string or as a file. For a file pass:

      load_query(source_file => $file);

    For a string:

      load_query(source_string => $string);

    If you want a specific service, call it thus:

      load_query(from => [$name, $user, $pass], source_string => $string);

    OR:

      load_query(from => [$name, $user, $pass], source_string => $string);

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query::Saved

  template( $name, [from => \@service_args], [%opts] )
    returns the named template (if it exists - if not it returns undef). If
    you pass a url, it returns the named template from the specified
    webservice.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query::Template

  saved_query( $name, [from => \@service_args], %options ) NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
    returns the named saved_query (if it exists - if not it returns undef).
    If you pass a url, it returns the named query from the specified
    webservice.

    This method requires you to have provided a username and password to the
    webservice for authentication.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query::Saved

  get_service( $url, $user, $pass )
    returns a webservice object, which is used to construct queries and
    fetch templates and saved queries. If a url is passed, the webservice
    for that url is returned, otherwise the service for the url given to
    "use" is returned.

    If a service for a url has been created previously, that one is
    returned, even if different login details are provided.

    Please see: Webservice::InterMine::Service

  get_saved_user_info($mine_name/$mine_url)
    Returns saved user name and passwords from the webservice config file if
    it exists. This file should be located at
    ~/.intermine-webservices.config, and should have the following format:

      flymine                        user@somewhere.edu password
      metabolicmine                  user@somewhere.edu another-password
      http://yeastmine.org/yeastmine user@somewhere.org A v3rj d1EE!kvlt 0n3

    ie., whitespace separated fields. The password may contain whitespace
    characters, but no new-lines. The mine-name/url needs to identical to
    the name used to request the service.

  clean_temp_lists()
    Deletes all automatically created anonymous lists. Any renamed lists
    will be spared the clean-up. This method is called on system exit,
    unless the variable $Webservice::InterMine::CLEAN_UP is set to a false
    value.

  get_{minename}(user, pass)
    An unknown method preceded with 'get_' will be interpreted as a mine
    name, and an attempt will be made to return a service with that name.
